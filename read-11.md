**What is EJS?**

*What is the `E` for? `Embedded?` Could be. How about `Effective,` `Elegant,` or just `Easy`?
 EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.*

*first of all you need to use npm install ejs to use this and as we do with express and cors we assign a variable to require ejs then you feed it a template file and an output file in the cli.and you can use variables to inject arrays and much more .*

**Conclusion**

*EJS lets us spin up quick applications when we donâ€™t need anything too complex. By using partials and having the ability to easily pass variables to our views, we can build some great applications quickly.*
