# EJS PARTIALS

![ejs](imgs/ejs.png)

---

*`EJS Partials` help us avoid repetition of the same code on several web pages.*

*For example, you may want the same header for several web pages.*

*`EJS partials` work like EJS layouts too in creating a single fix content on a web page.*

*Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.*

---

*creating and including partials is very straightforward with EJS. Iâ€™ve intentionally left in some placeholders such as LIST_OF_POSTS, POST_TITLE, POST_AUTHOR, and POST_CONTENT so that we can take a look at how we can pass data from our Node + Express application to our views in the next section.*
